# Home-Automation
The project involves designing a system based on two infrared proximity sensors attached to the door which acts as a counter to detect whether a person has entered a room or not. The Arduino is connected to a relay module which acts as a switch to turn on and off the lights depending upon whether there is someone in the room or not. It requires basic Arduino Programming skills and was presented in APOGEE 2016, BITS-Pilani Technical Fest.
